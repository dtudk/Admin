name: New repository
about: Create a new project hosted at github.com/dtudk/<project>

---

**Project name**
<!--
Clearly state what the project name is
-->

**License**
<!--
Choose a license, if in doubt, please consult DTU Legal for guidance on selecting a license
fitting your project and long term goals.
-->

**Maintainer User**
<!--
Give a list of users that should be given maintainer access.
Note that a maintainer for projects may add members to the project at will.
Please ensure that contributors confirm the project license and that you have a clear contributing guideline.
If additional developers should be given access a priori, please state these users as well.
-->

**SNF**
<!--
One of two cases needs to be fulfilled:
1. A positive statement from your Institute's innovation responsible, saying that it is ok to publish
   the open-source project.
2. A full Software Notification Form from the legal department. This is a more formal procedure
   and can take more time, however, there will be professional advice on how to decide
   on the license, and ensuring that one does not violate any of the dependencies licenses.

The SNF can be found here:

**Associated Data**
<!--
The GitHub hosting facility does not scale well with huge binary data.
If your project has large data files associated, we encourage the use of DTU Data
and an intermediate download mechanism to decouple code development and data management.

Always try and retain as few binary files in the repository as possible.

For DTU Data access, please see here https://data.dtu.dk/
