## Adminstrative project

An administrative project helping [DTU](www.dtu.dk) researchers to create and/or share code projects under a common DTU namespace.

Please open a [new issue](https://github.com/dtudk/Admin/issues/new/choose) in this project for new users and creating repositories.
Or, [open a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/dtudk/discussions/categories/ask-for-a-sub-repo).  

If you have questions; either open a issue or contact us at [mycode@dtu.dk](mailto:mycode@dtu.dk).


### Requesting a repository

Any DTU employee can get a repository.  
Open a [new issue](https://github.com/dtudk/Admin/issues/new/choose), choose
`New repository` and follow the instructions.  
Or, [open a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/dtudk/discussions/categories/ask-for-a-sub-repo) asking for a repository.  

See following items for detailed information.


#### Opensource/public codes

- Obtain a [Software Notification Form](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/da/medarbejder/om-dtu-campus-og-bygninger/kommunikation-og-design/meddelelser/meddelelser_dtuansatte/meddelelsevisning?id={FA708C06-2270-423B-907D-91F1C8B7D0A3}) from [here](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/da/medarbejder/forskning-innovation-og-raadgivning/forskningssamarbejde-jura-og-kontraktforhold/om-software/software-der-ikke-oenskes-kommercialiseret)
- Choose a license for the software
- Choose a unique repository name
- A list of DTU users that will gain access.  
  Please designate at least 1 maintainer. This maintainer can invite members at will.
- In case the software has significant amount of data, we encourage the use of [DTU Data](https://data.dtu.dk/)


<!--
#### Closed/private codes

These codes may be created with `Private` visibility level meaning that others have no access.

Since these are hidden they don't disclose any source code for other users and one need not assign
licenses. However, we still encourage as many items in the previous section.

### Adding users

Our [permission table](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization) is restrictive in the sense that we have to retain ownership of project folders due to
legal issues. Therefore users *have* to request a project before it can be created.

Our basic permissions are:

- `Write` flags are given to members who can contribute
- `Maintain` flags are given to those who control the project.

To add a new user to projects, contact a person with the `Maintain` role of the project.
